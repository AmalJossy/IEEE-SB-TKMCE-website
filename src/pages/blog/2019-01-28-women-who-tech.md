There are a number of excellent opportunities for female engineering students out there. These opportunities mostly provide financial aid for young, smart women to pursue technology, and also facilitate mentor-ship/industry connect for them to excel in their career. But the problem is that most of the female pursuants are unaware of these opportunities that could probably change their lives. This was the foundation for initiating such an event in the college. IEEE IAS TKMCE and Women cell TKMCE joined hands to hold a session on scholarships for women.
