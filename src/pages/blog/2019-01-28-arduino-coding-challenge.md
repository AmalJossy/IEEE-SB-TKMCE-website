Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) chapter of IEEE SB TKMCE organized an Arduino coding competition for the Arduino geeks on 22nd October 2018. Competitors had a great time cracking the question with arduino & codes from their pulse. The few hours made the geeks out there breath life into LEDs through the codes. We had the team comprising Anurag and  Anuvind cracking the coding competition. This was a most awaited event as far as first year and second year students, who have just stepped into the world of technology were concerned.
