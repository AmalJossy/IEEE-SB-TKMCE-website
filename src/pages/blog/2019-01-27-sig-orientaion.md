A Special Interest Group for technical training was formed under IEEE SB TKMCE. Orientation was given to the students to make them aware of the purposes of the group. Introductory class on AI and IoT was taken by the senior member of IEEE SB TKMCE. More than 90 students attended the session. Mentors were introduced to the students and future plans of the group was structured. The major driving force behind the formation of SIG was to make sure that every student without missing a single passionate student are involved in a topic of their choice. The SB takes the role of a linker wherein we provide the students with what they want.
