The SIG (Special Interest Group) for IOT and AI have achieved tremendous results as far as increasing the familiarity of the students in these fields. The initiative has come out as a great success and the strength of the program is increasing everyday. To develop the skills of the students on a more practical platform, the IAS SC IEEE and IEDC TKMCE organised a bluetooth roborace which was a racing competition for bluetooth controlled robotic vehicles. The competition taught the students to incorporate robotics and IOT and gave them scope for future developments.
