'Hawking: A Life like No Other' was organised to honor the life and works of the renowned physicist, Dr. Stephen Hawking. It was organised on 16th March 2018, in the EEE seminar hall. A lot of students from all the branches attended the event, to pay tribute to the scientist. The event began with the screening of the 2016 documentary, 'Favourite Places', featuring a voice-over from Hawking. The documentary was a visual treat that took the viewers on a trip of Hawking's favorite places in the universe. This was followed by a brief discussion on modern physics and research opportunities in undergraduate level.
