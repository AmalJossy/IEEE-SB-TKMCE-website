The global chair of IEEE Humanitarian Activities committee Paul Cunningham visited TKMCE. He had an interaction with the faculty and students of the SB. The various events taking place in the SB was brought to his notice. The student volunteers and the teachers keenly explained the various projects running at IEEE SB TKMCE and the students who are taking part in them. He gave valuable suggestions on various humanitarian activities that can be done in the current scenario. To interact with a man of his profile was a great moment in the careers of the faculties and student members.
