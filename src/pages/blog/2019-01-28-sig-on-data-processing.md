The second full session of Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence was conducted on October 8, 2018. The session was handled by Parth Suresh of CSE who introduced the students to the statistical approach of exploratory data analysis for summarizing data. He presented exploratory techniques that ensured whether machine learning algorithms can be used in a project, on how to choose suitable algorithms for our data set and to define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning. The session was attended by more than 50 students comprising of IAS and non-IAS members. As done for the previous SIG sessions, detailed follow-up plans were prepared for the SIG Data processing.
