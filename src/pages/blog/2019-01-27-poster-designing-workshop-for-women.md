In accordance with Women's Day 2018, IEEE Computer Society Chapter, IEEE WIE TKMCE jointly organized a Poster Designing workshop on 05th March 2018 and a Video Editing Workshop on Tuesday.. Designing is an art, and to master it takes nothing more than the ability to explore! We have a set of exemplary designers in the classrooms of TKMCE and the experience they have was passed on to their college mates in this event. The target of the event was to have an ideology change that the fields like poster designing can be explored by both men and women alike. To empower our girl students and to give them the confidence to give the wings to their creativity, the event was wholeheartedly supported.
